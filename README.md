# Requirements

Before installing the application, make sure you have:

### Operating System

* Windows 10 Build 2004 or later
* Windows 11

> Meeting-audio loopback and Windows overlay functionality currently depend on Windows-specific APIs.

### Python

* Python 3.10 or later

Check your Python version:

```cmd
python --version
```

### AI Provider

You need at least one of:

* Groq API key
* OpenAI API key
* Mistral AI API key
* Local Ollama installation

### Hardware

For voice and meeting features:

* Working microphone
* Working audio-output/loopback device

---

# Installation

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Yashwanthgowda1/AI-Assistant.git
```

Move into the project directory:

```cmd
cd AI-Assistant
```

---

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a Python virtual environment:

```cmd
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

### Command Prompt

```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### PowerShell

```powershell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

After activation, you should see something similar to:

```text
(venv) C:\...\AI-Assistant>
```

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 4: Create the `.env` File

Copy the example environment file:

### Command Prompt

```cmd
copy .env.example .env
```

### PowerShell

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

---

# Configuration

Open the `.env` file and configure your preferred AI provider.

## Option 1: Groq

```env
AI_PROVIDER=groq
AI_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

## Option 2: OpenAI

```env
AI_PROVIDER=openai
AI_MODEL=your_openai_model
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Option 3: Mistral AI

```env
AI_PROVIDER=mistral
AI_MODEL=your_mistral_model
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
```

## Option 4: Ollama

Install and run Ollama locally, then configure:

```env
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
AI_MODEL=your_local_model
```

# Run the Application

There are two ways to start the application.

## Method 1: Using `run.bat`

From the project directory:

```cmd
run.bat
```

The script will set up the environment, install dependencies, and launch the application.

---

## Method 2: Run Using Python

If the environment is already configured:

```cmd
python main.py
```

---

# Quick Start

After starting the application:

### Step 1: Enter a Question

Type an interview question into the input box.

Example:

```text
Explain the difference between Selenium and Playwright.
```

Click the button to generate an answer.

---

### Step 2: Use Voice Input

Click the **Microphone** button.

Speak your question.

The application converts your voice input into text and sends it to the configured AI provider.

---

### Step 3: Analyse the Screen

Click:

```text
Analyse Screen
```

The application captures the screen and uses vision-based analysis to identify the question.

This is useful for questions displayed in:

* Browser pages
* Coding platforms
* Documents
* Interview applications

---

### Step 4: Upload Your Resume

Click:

```text
Upload Resume
```

Select your resume:

```text
PDF
DOCX
TXT
```

The application extracts the resume content and uses it as context when generating answers.

---

### Step 5: Enable Meeting Audio

Enable:

```text
Meeting
```

The application can capture supported system/loopback audio and transcribe the conversation.

Supported meeting applications can include:

* Zoom
* Google Meet
* Microsoft Teams

---

### Step 6: Select AI Provider

Open the **Settings** panel.

Select your preferred provider:

```text
Groq
OpenAI
Mistral
Ollama
```

You can also configure the model and API settings from the application where supported.

---

### Step 7: Toggle the Overlay

Use the global keyboard shortcut:

```text
Ctrl + Shift + Space
```

to show or hide the floating assistant window.

Ctrl + Shift + Space
```

to toggle the overlay.

> Screen-capture and screen-sharing behavior depends on the Windows version and the application being used.

---
